# YIT_assignment
built an API that support web pages for YIT assignment

This is a Django project that support YIT provided web pages.
I created a REST API which interact with the web pages.

In order to run this locally clone the repository to your machine,
install python (I used python 3.11) and run the command "**pip install -r requirements.txt**" in the terminal in the project root directory where the requirements.txt file is located.
After you installed all the neccessry packeges, run the Django project be running the command "**python manage.py runserver**" in the terminal in the project root where the manage.py is located.

When the server is runnig you can access the project main page by navigating to the url "**http://127.0.0.1:8000/component/**", from this page you can navigate to any of the pages.

Goodluck!
